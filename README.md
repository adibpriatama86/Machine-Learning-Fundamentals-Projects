# Machine Learning Fundamentals Projects

This repository contains supervised machine learning projects developed as part of the Machine Learning Fundamentals course.

## Projects
### 1. Classification
- Multiclass and binary classification using public datasets
- Models: Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

### 2. Regression
- Linear Regression for continuous value prediction
- Evaluation: MSE, RMSE, R²
- Visualization: Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Notes
These projects focus on understanding core ML workflows, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and interpreting model limitations.
